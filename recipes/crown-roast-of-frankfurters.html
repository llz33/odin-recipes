    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Slice frankfurters lengthwise, but do not cut all the way through. 
            (Do not separate halves.)</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>

            about 5 minutes. </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Add vinegar and poppy seeds to cabbage; toss thoroughly. Heap cabbage 
            in a mound in center of a baking dish. </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Lean cut side of frankfurters against cabbage to form a crown.
                 Secure franfurters with toothpicks.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Pour water over cabbage. Bake at 350Â° (moderate oven) 10 minutes, or 
                until cabbage is tender but still crisp. </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Garnish with pimento. Divide evenly. Makes 4 dinner servings.</p>
    <h3><i>Note</i></h3>
